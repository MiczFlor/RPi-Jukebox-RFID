#!/bin/bash

# This script saves or restores the last position (song and time) in a playlist (=folder)
# Saving and restoring will only be made if a "lastplayed.dat" file is found in the folder where the 
# audio is stored.
# Usage: 
# Save the position: ./resume_play.sh -c=savepos
# Restore position and play or play from playlist position: ./resume_play-sh -c=resume -v=playlist_pos
# Enable resume for folder: ./resume_play-sh -c=enableresume -v=foldername_in_audiofolders
# Disable resume for folder: ./resume_play-sh -c=disableresume -v=foldername_in_audiofolders
#
# Call this script with "savepos" everytime
# - before you clear the playlist (mpc clear)
# - before you stop the player
# - before you shutdown the Pi (maybe not necessary as mpc stores the position between reboots, but it feels saver)
