Publishing Server
********************

The common publishing server for the entire Jukebox using ZeroMQ

Structure
----------------

.. code-block:: text

  +-----------------------+
  |  functional interface |   Publisher
  |                       |     - functional interface for single Thread
  |        PUB            |     - sends data to publisher (and thus across threads)
  +-----------------------+
            | (1)
            v
  +-----------------------+
  |        SUB (bind)     |   PublishServer
  |                       |     - Last Value (LV) Cache
  |        XPUB (bind)    |     - Subscriber notification and LV resend
  +-----------------------+     - independent thread
            | (2)
            v

Connection (1): Internal connection
    Internal connection only - do not use (no, not even inside this App for you own plugins - always bind to the PublishServer)

    Protocol: Multi-part message

    Part 1: Topic (in topic tree format)
        E.g. player.status.elapsed

    Part 2: Payload or Message in json serialization
        If empty (i.e. ``b''``), it means delete the topic sub-tree from cache. And instruct subscribers to do the same

    Part 3: Command
        Usually empty, i.e. ``b''``. If not empty the message is treated as command for the PublishServer
        and the message is not forwarded to the outside. This third part of the message is never forwarded

Connection (2): External connection
    Upon connection of a new subscriber, the entire current state is resend from cache to ALL subscribers!
    Subscribers must subscribe to topics. Topics are treated as topic trees! Subscribing to a root tree will
    also get you all the branch topics. To get everything, subscribe to ``b''``

    Protocol: Multi-part message

    Part 1: Topic (in topic tree format)
        E.g. player.status.elapsed

    Part 2: Payload or Message in json serialization
        If empty (i.e. b''), it means the subscriber must delete this key locally (not valid anymore)

Why? Why?
-------------

Check out the `ZeroMQ Documentation  <https://zguide.zeromq.org/docs/chapter5>`_
for why you need a proxy in a good design.

For use case, we made a few simplifications

Design Rationales
-------------------

* "If you need `millions of messages per second <https://zguide.zeromq.org/docs/chapter5/#Pros-and-Cons-of-Pub-Sub>`_
  sent to thousands of points,
  you’ll appreciate pub-sub a lot more than if you need a few messages a second sent to a handful of recipients."
* "lower-volume network with a few dozen subscribers and a limited number of topics, we can use TCP and then
  the `XSUB and XPUB <https://zguide.zeromq.org/docs/chapter5/#Last-Value-Caching>`_"
* "Let’s imagine `our feed has an average of 100,000 100-byte messages a second
  <https://zguide.zeromq.org/docs/chapter5/#High-Speed-Subscribers-Black-Box-Pattern>`_ [...].
  While 100K messages a second is easy for a ZeroMQ application, ..."

**But we have:**

* few dozen subscribers             --> Check!
* limited number of topics          --> Check!
* max ~10 messages per second       --> Check!
* small common state information    --> Check!
* only the server updates the state --> Check!

This means, we can use less complex patters than used for these high-speed, high code count, high data rate networks :-)

* XPUB / XSUB to detect new subscriber
* Cache the entire state in the publisher
* Re-send the entire state on-demand (and then even to every subscriber)
* Using the same channel: sends state to every subscriber

**Reliability considerations**

* Late joining client (or drop-off and re-join): get full state update
* Server crash etc: No special handling necessary, we are simple
  and don't need recovery in this case. Server will publish initial state
  after re-start
* Subscriber too slow: Subscribers problem (TODO: Do we need to do anything about it?)

**Start-up sequence:**

* Publisher plugin is first plugin to be loaded
* Due to Publisher - PublisherServer structure no further sequencing required

Plugin interactions and usage
------------------------------

RPC can trigger through function call in components/publishing plugin that

* entire state is re-published  (from the cache)
* a specific topic tree is re-published (from the cache)

Plugins publishing state information should publish initial state at @plugin.finalize

.. important:: Do not direclty instantiate the Publisher in your plugin module. Only one Publisher is
    required per thread. But the publisher instance **must** be thread-local!
    Always go through :func:`publishing.get_publisher()`.

**Sockets**

Three sockets are opened:

#. TCP (on a configurable port)
#. Websocket  (on a configurable port)
#. Inproc: On ``inproc://PublisherToProxy`` all topics are published app-internally. This can be used for plugin modules
   that want to know about the current state on event based updates.

# Developer's notes:
#
# For an explanation why you only need a single bind() for all future connect() requests,
# see the following two links:
# [https://zeromq.org/socket-api/#bind-vs-connect]
# [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50753588/zeromq-with-norm-address-already-in-use-error-was-thrown-on-2nd-bind-why]
#
# How to integrate MQTT:
#   Create a transport bridge similar to [https://zguide.zeromq.org/docs/chapter2/#Transport-Bridging]
#   which connects to the XPUB of the PublishServer
#
# Options for later (if needed)
#   - Sequence number for clients to know they missed nothing (but we know that anyway because of 0MQ connection...)
#     Maybe for the suicidal snail pattern ?
#   - Time to live (for auto-expiring topics)
