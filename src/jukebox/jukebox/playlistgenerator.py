"""
Playlists are build from directory content in the following way:
a directory is parsed and files are added to the playlist in the following way

1. files are added in alphabetic order
2. files ending with ``*livestream.txt`` are unpacked and the containing URL(s) are added verbatim to the playlist
3. files ending with ``*podcast.txt`` are unpacked and the containing Podcast URL(s) are expanded and added to the playlist
4. files ending with ``*.m3u`` are treated as folder playlist. Regular folder processing is suspended and the playlist
   is build solely from the ``*.m3u`` content. Only the alphabetically first ``*.m3u`` is processed. URLs are added verbatim
   to the playlist except for ``*.xml`` and ``*.podcast`` URLS, which are expanded first

An directory may contain a mixed set of files and multiple ``*.txt`` files, e.g.

.. code-block:: bash

    01-livestream.txt
    02-livestream.txt
    music.mp3
    podcast.txt

All files are treated as music files and are added to the playlist, except those:

 * starting with ``.``,
 * not having a file ending, i.e. do not contain a ``.``,
 * ending with ``.txt``,
 * ending with ``.m3u``,
 * ending with one of the excluded file endings in :attr:`PlaylistCollector._exclude_endings`

In recursive mode, the playlist is generated by concatenating all sub-folder playlists. Sub-folders are parsed
in alphabetic order. Symbolic links are being followed. The above rules are enforced on a per-folder bases.
This means, one ``*.m3u`` file per sub-folder is processed (if present).

In ``*.txt`` and ``*.m3u`` files, all lines starting with ``#`` are ignored.

# Some developers notes:
# So far this is only for MPD (no spotify)
#
# It is not planned to support mopidy (we use something different for spotify). If ever only the
# self.default_handler would need to be replaced
# to add add(local:track:filename") and not only add "filename" (with also probably some encoding)
#
# Generally speaking, the decode..() functions below do decoding and formatting of file entries
# The most general solution would be to split that. Use an intermediate format based on a NamedTuple which
# contains the URI and the type of URI (where it was parsed from). After playlist has been collected, run a formatter
# that formats the NamedTuple to URI strings according to player
# This also does not consider a mixed player setup (mpd/spotify)
