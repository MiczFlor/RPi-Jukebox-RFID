    CAUTION - WARNING
    ========================================================================
    Lithium and other batteries are dangerous and must be treated with care.
    Rechargeable Lithium Ion batteries are potentially hazardous and can
    present a serious FIRE HAZARD if damaged, defective or improperly used.
    Do not use this circuit to a lithium ion battery without expertise and
    training in handling and use of batteries of this type.
    Use appropriate test equipment and safety protocols during development.

    There is no warranty, this may not work as expected or at all!
    =========================================================================
