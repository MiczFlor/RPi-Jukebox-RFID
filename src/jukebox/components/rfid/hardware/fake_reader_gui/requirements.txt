# This GUI-based mock reader also requires: tkinter
# tkinter is a standard Python package and needs not be installed separately
# It is available on most Unix systems (but not on headless Raspbian RPi where running a GUI is difficult anyway)
# You need to install these with `python -m pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall -q -r requirements.txt`
