    Note: This runs in a separate thread. And this may cause troubles
    when changing the volume level before
    and after the sound playback: There is nothing to prevent another
    thread from changing the volume and sink while playback happens
    and afterwards we change the volume back to where it was before!

    There is no way around this dilemma except for not running the jingle as a
    separate thread. Currently (as thread) even the RPC is started before the sound
    is finished and the volume is reset to normal...

    However: Volume plugin is loaded before jingle and sets the default
    volume. No interference here. It can now only happen
    if (a) through the RPC or (b) some other plugin the volume is changed. Okay, now
    (a) let's hope that there is enough delay in the user requesting a volume change
    (b) let's hope no other plugin wants to do that
    (c) no bluetooth device connects during this time (and pulseaudio control is set to toggle_on_connect)
    and take our changes with the threaded approach.
