The voltage level of the RX/TX is 3.3V despite the wide-spread belief
that it is 5V. (At least on the boards I have). I did check with an
oscilloscope. And one can easily identify the AMS1117 LDO voltage
regulator on the backside of the board.

No warranties: If you meddle with GPIOs you are old enough to know the
risks of wrong voltage levels.
