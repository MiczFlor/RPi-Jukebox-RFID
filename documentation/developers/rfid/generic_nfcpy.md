# Generic NFCPy Reader

This module is based on the user space NFC reader library [nfcpy](https://nfcpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html) ([on github](https://github.com/nfcpy/nfcpy)).
The link above also contains a list of [supported devices](https://nfcpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html#supported-devices).

The goal of this module is to handle USB NFC devices, that don't have a HID-keyboard
driver, and thus cannot be used with the [genericusb](genericusb.md) module. 

> [!NOTE]
> Since nfcpy is a user-space library, it is required to supress the kernel from loading its driver.
> The setup will do this automatically, so make sure the device is connected
> before running the [RFID reader configuration tool](../coreapps.md#RFID-Reader).

# Configuration

The installation script will scan for compatible devices and will assist in configuration. 
By setting `rfid > readers > generic_nfcpy > config > device_path` in `shared/settings/rfid.yaml` you can override the
device location. By specifying an explicit device location it is possible to use multiple readers compatible with NFCpy.

Example configuration for a usb-device with vendor ID 072f and product ID 2200:
```yaml
rfid:
  readers:
    read_00:
      module: generic_nfcpy
      config:
        device_path: usb:072f:2200
      same_id_delay: 1.0
      log_ignored_cards: false
      place_not_swipe:
        enabled: false
        card_removal_action:
          alias: pause
```

For possible values see the `path` parameter in this [nfcpy documentation](https://nfcpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/clf.html#nfc.clf.ContactlessFrontend.open)
