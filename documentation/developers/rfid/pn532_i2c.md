# PN532 I2C Reader

The PN532-based readers connected via I2C

This reader module is based on the [py532lib
library](https://github.com/HubCityLabs/py532lib) and uses the I2C bus.
It utilizes a polling mechanism. It only needs 2 pins, but has a certain
performance overhead due to polling.

## Options

There are no configurable options for this module.

## Hardware

This reader module has been tested with the excellent and highly
recommendable [Adafruit PN532 breakout
board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/364). It also comes with [heaps
of documentation and even
schematics](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-pn532-rfid-nfc/downloads).

I have used various RFID boards and this one has an excellent reading
range and no problem with various types of cards and stickers.

## Board Connections

### Default wiring

| PN532 | RPI GPIO     | RPI Pin |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| 5V    | 5V           | > 4     |
| GND   | GND          | > 6     |
| SDA   | GPIO 2 (SDA) | > 3     |
| SCL   | GPIO 3 (SCL) | > 5     |

Other pins from the Adafruit board need not be connected. Especially do
**not** connect the 3.3V pin, if connecting the 5.0V pin. It is
recommended to use the 5.0V because that does not draw power from the
PI's own voltage regulator.

## Jumpers

### Jumper settings for I2C protocol

| Jumper | Position |
|--------|----------|
|SEL0    | ON       |
|SEL1    | OFF      |
