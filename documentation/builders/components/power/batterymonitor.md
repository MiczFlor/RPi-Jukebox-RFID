## Battery Monitor based on an INA219

The script in [src/jukebox/components/battery_monitor/batt_mon_i2c_ina219/\_\_init\_\_.py](../../../../src/jukebox/components/battery_monitor/batt_mon_i2c_ina219/__init__.py) is intended to read out the voltage of a single cell or multiple LiIon Battery using a [INA219 Board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/904):

                                                  3.3V

             ===                  ===             ===
```

## Configuration example

The battery monitoring is configured in the jukebox.yml file.

The "battmon" module has to be added to the modules setting.

```text
modules:
  named:
    # Do not change the order!
    publishing: publishing
    ...
    battmon: battery_monitor.batt_mon_i2c_ina219
```

The battmon module needs further configuration:

```yaml
battmon:
  scale_to_phy_num: 1
  scale_to_phy_denom: 0
  warning_action:
  all_clear_action:
```

The setting "scale_to_phy_denom" does not influence the INA219. However, the scale can be adjusted to fit multiple LiIon cells.
