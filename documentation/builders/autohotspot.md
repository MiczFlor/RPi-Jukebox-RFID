# Auto-Hotspot

The Auto-Hotspot function allows the Jukebox to switch between its
connection between a known WiFi and an automatically generated hotspot
so that you can still access via SSH or Webapp.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please configure the WiFi connection to your home access point before enabling these feature!

To create a hotspot and allow clients to connect
[hostapd](http://w1.fi/hostapd/) and [dnsmasq](https://thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html).

## How to connect

When the Jukebox is not able to connect to a known WiFi it will create a
hotspot named `Phoniebox_Hotspot`. You will be able to connect to this
hotspot using the given password in the installation or the default
password: `PlayItLoud!`

### Webapp

After connecting to the `Phoniebox_Hotspot` you are able to connect to
the webapp accessing the website [10.0.0.5](http://10.0.0.5/).

### ssh

After connecting to the `Phoniebox_Hotspot` you are able to connect via
ssh to your Jukebox

``` bash
ssh <username>@10.0.0.5
```

## Changing basic configuration of the hotspot

The whole hotspot configuration can be found at
`/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf`.

The following parameters are relevant:

- `ssid` for the displayed hotspot name
- `wpa_passphrase` for the password of the hotspot
- `country_code` the country you are currently in

``` bash
$ cat /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf

#2.4GHz setup wifi 80211 b,g,n
interface=wlan0
driver=nl80211
ssid=Phoniebox_Hotspot
hw_mode=g
channel=8
wmm_enabled=0
macaddr_acl=0
auth_algs=1
ignore_broadcast_ssid=0
wpa=2
wpa_passphrase==PlayItLoud!
wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
wpa_pairwise=CCMP TKIP
rsn_pairwise=CCMP

#80211n - Change GB to your WiFi country code
country_code=DE
ieee80211n=1
ieee80211d=1
```

## Disabling automatism

Auto-Hotspot can be enabled or disabled using the Webapp.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Disabling or enabling will keep the last state.

## Troubleshooting

### Phoniebox is not connecting to the known WiFi

The script will fall back to the hotspot so you still have some type of
connection.

Check your password in `/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf`.

### AutoHotspot functionality is not working

You can check the output of the script by running the following script:

``` bash
$ sudo /usr/bin/autohotspot
```

### You need to add a new wifi network to the Raspberry Pi

Because it is in Auto-Hotspot mode, you won\'t be able to scan for new
wifi signals.

You will need to add a new network to
`/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf` manually. Enter the following
details replacing mySSID and myPassword with your details. If your WiFi
has a hidden SSID then include the line `scan_ssid=1`.
