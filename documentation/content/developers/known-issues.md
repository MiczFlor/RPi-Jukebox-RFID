# Known Issues

## Browsers

The Web UI will **not** work with Firefox, due to an issue with websockets and pyzmq. Please use a different
browser for now.

## Configuration

In `jukebox.yaml` (and all other config files): do not use relative paths with `~/some/dir`.
Always use entire explicit path, e.g. `/home/pi/some/dir`.

**Sole** exception is in `playermpd.mpd_conf`.
