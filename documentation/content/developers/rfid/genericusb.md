# Generic USB Reader

**place-capable**: typically no

This module covers all types of USB-based RFID input readers. If you
plan to connect multiple USB-based RFID readers to the Jukebox, make
sure to connect all of them before running the registration tool [run_register_rfid_reader.py](../coreapps.md).
