# Development Environment

You have 3 development options:

## Directly on Raspberry Pi

The full setup is running on the RPi and you access files via SSH.
Pretty easy to set up as you simply do a normal install and switch to
the `future3/develop` branch.

### Steps to install

We recommend to use at least a Pi 3 or Pi Zero 2 for development. This
hardware won\'t be needed in production, but it can be slow while
developing.

1.  Install the latest Pi OS on a SD card.
2.  Boot up your Raspberry Pi.
3.  [Install](../userguide/installation.md) the Jukebox software as if you were building a
    Phoniebox. You can install from your own fork and feature branch if
    you wish which can be changed later as well. The original repository
    will be set as `upstream`.
4.  Once the installation has successfully ran, reboot your Pi.
5.  Due to some resource constraints, the Webapp does not build the
    latest changes and instead consumes the latest official release. To
    change that, you need to install NodeJS and build the Webapp
    locally.
6.  Install NodeJS using the existing installer

    ``` bash
    cd ~/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/installation/routines; \
    source setup_jukebox_webapp.sh; \
    _jukebox_webapp_install_node
    ```

7.  To free up RAM, reboot your Pi.
8.  Build the Webapp using the existing build command. If the build
    fails, you might have forgotten to reboot.

    ``` bash
    cd ~/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/src/webapp; \
    ./run_rebuild.sh -u
    ```

9.  The Webapp should now be updated.
10. To continuously update Webapp, pull the latest changes from your
    repository and rerun the command above.

## Locally on any Linux machine

The jukebox also runs on any Linux machine. The Raspberry Pi specific
stuff will not work of course. That is no issue depending our your
development area. USB RFID Readers, however, will work. You may setup a
Python virtual environment or a conda virtual environment. You will have
to install and configure [MPD (Music Player
Daemon)](https://www.musicpd.org/).

In addition to the `requirements.txt`, you will this
dependency. On the Raspberry PI, the latest stable release of ZMQ does
not support WebSockets. We need to compile the latest version from
Github, which is taken care of by the installation script. For regular
machines, the normal package can be installed:

``` bash
pip install pyzmq
```

You will have to start Jukebox core application and the WebUI
separately. The MPD usually runs as a service.

## Using Docker container

There is a complete [Docker setup](./docker.md).
