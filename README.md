## Introduction

Phoniebox is a contactless jukebox for the Raspberry Pi, playing audio files, playlists, podcasts, web streams and spotify triggered by RFID cards. All plug and play via USB, no soldering iron needed. It also features GPIO buttons control support.

## Important Notice regarding Spotify Integration

**Spotify has [disabled access to libspotify on May 16, 2022](https://developer.spotify.com/community/news/2022/04/12/libspotify-sunset/).**

This means **Spotify in Phoniebox doesn't work at the moment**. For further information see [Spotify FAQ](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/wiki/Spotify-FAQ)

We are working to provide an integrated solution.
For Version 2 there is a possible fix to reactivate spotify with a manual installation described [here](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/issues/1815#issuecomment-1666535983).
For Version 3 [#2164](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/pull/2164) is laying the groundwork. Help is greatly appreciated.

## Install Phoniebox

### üî• Version 3 is coming

The goal for Version 3 was to tidy up the codebase, focus on a single programming language for the core (Python), establish a solid plugin system and build a responsive web client. [Read on here if you want to learn about more reasons](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/blob/future3/main/documentation/README.md).

#### üëã Looking for adopters, testers and contributors

If you want to test or help develop this new version called `future3`, let us know what you think about the new architecture, the new web application and help us find bugs (or fix them proactively).

While Version 3 is still under development, it is becoming a lot more stable! Although not all of the features from version 2.x have been ported to version 3 so far.

* Script daemon is closing down unexpectedly.
* Everything seems to work, but I hear nothing when swiping a card.
* I would like to use two cards / IDs to do the same thing.

## Hardware aka Shopping List

Here is a list of equipment needed. You can find a lot second hand online (save money and the planet). The links below lead to Amazon, not at all because I want to support them, but because their PartnerNet program helps to support the Phoniebox maintenance (a little bit...).

Note: depending on individual projects, the hardware requirements vary.

### Raspberry Pi

* [Raspberry Pi 4 Modell B](https://amzn.to/2Yuei04)
* [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B](https://amzn.to/3fqp8ef)
* [Raspberry Pi Zero WH](https://amzn.to/3fkfKc5)

You might be surprised how easy and affordable you can get an RPi second hand. Think about the planet before you buy a new one.

### RFID Reader and cards / fobs

* RFID Card Reader (USB): [Neuftech USB RFID Reader ID](https://amzn.to/2RrqScm) using 125 kHz - make sure to buy compatible cards, RFID stickers or key fobs working with the same frequency as the reader.
  * RFID cards: [125 KHz EM4100](https://amzn.to/37pjy9q) make sure the frequency matches the RFID card reader!  
  * RFID fobs / key rings: [EM4100 RFID-Transponder-Schl√ºsselring, 125 KHz](https://amzn.to/3hsuvLO) make sure the frequency matches the RFID card reader!
* RFID Kit RC522: [RC522 Reader, Chip, Card for Raspberry Pi 13.56MHz](https://amzn.to/2C7YZCZ)
  * RFID sticker / tags: [MIFARE RFID NFC Tags](https://amzn.to/30GfLDg) untested by me personally, but reported to work with work with RC522 and PN532 card readers.  

### Speakers / amps

* [USB Stereo Speaker Set (6 Watt, 3,5mm jack, USB-powered) black](http://amzn.to/2kXrard) | This USB powered speaker set sounds good for its size, is good value for money and keeps this RPi project clean and without the need of a soldering iron :)
* [USB A Male to Female Extenstion Cable with Switch On/Off](http://amzn.to/2hHrvkG) | I placed this USB extension between the USB power adapter and the Phoniebox. This will allow you to switch the Phoniebox on and off easily.
* [USB 2.0 Hub 4-port bus powered USB Adapter](http://amzn.to/2kXeErv) | Depending on your setup, you will need none, one or two of these. If you are using the external USB powered speakers, you need one to make sure the speakers get enough power. If you want to use the additional USB soundcard and have an older RPi, you might need a second one to make sure you can connect enough devices with the RPi.

### Arcade Buttons

* [USB Interface for Arcade buttons](https://amzn.to/3nRAtIS) if you insist on not soldering hardware.
* Arcade Buttons / Sensors (one of these might suit you)
  * [Arcade Buttons / Schalter in various colours](https://amzn.to/2QMxe9r) if you want buttons for the GPIO control.
  * [Arcade Buttons wit LED and custom icons](https://amzn.to/2MWQ6hq) as used by [@splitti](https://splittscheid.de/selfmade-phoniebox/#3C).
  * [Set: Arcade Buttons / Tasten / Schalter](https://amzn.to/2T81JTZ) GPIO Extension Board Starter Kit including cables and breadboard.
  * [Touch Sensor / Kapazitive Touch Tasten](https://amzn.to/2Vc4ntx) these are not buttons to press but to touch as GPIO controls.

### Special hardware

These are links to additional items, which will add an individual flavour to your Phoniebox setup. Consult the issue threads to see if your idea has been realised already.

* [Ground Loop Isolator / Entst√∂rfilter Audio](https://amzn.to/2Kseo0L) this seems to [get rid off crackles in the audio out (a typical RPi problem)](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/issues/341)
* [Mechanical audio switch](https://amzn.to/35oOSCS) if you want to connect differen audio devices, this is the easiest way (in connection with the *Ground Loop Isolator* you will get good results)
* [Rotary Encoder / Drehregler / Dial](https://amzn.to/2J34guF) for volume control. Read here for more information on how to [integrate the rotary dial](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/issues/267)
* [HiFiBerry DAC+ Soundcard](https://amzn.to/2J36cU9) Read here for more information on how to [HifiBerry Soundcard integration](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/wiki/HiFiBerry-Soundcard-Details)
* [HDMI zu HDMI + Optisches SPDIF mit 3,5-mm-Stereo-HDMI Audio-Extractor | HDMI zu SPDIF Konverter](https://amzn.to/2N8KP8C) If you plan to use video, this might be the better solution than a USB soundcard or the hifiberry. If takes up some space, but will work with the HDMI audio out and split the signal to deliver audio through 3.5mm jack.

### Components

Special hardware is now organised in the folder [`components`](components/). If you have new hardware attached to your Phoniebox, please add to this library! It currently contains soundcards, displays, GPIO controls, RFID reader, smarthome integration.

**What makes this Phoniebox easy to install and use:**

* Runs on all Raspberry Pi models (1, 2, 3 and 4) and [Raspberry Zero](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/issues/15).
* Just plug and play using USB, no soldering iron needed.
* Once the Phoniebox is up and running, add music from any computer on your home network.
* Register new RFID cards easily without having to connect to the RPi.
* Play single or multiple files, podcasts or web streams.
* Volume control is also done with RFID cards or key fobs.
* Connect to your Phoniebox via your wifi network or run the Phoniebox like an access point and connect directly without a router.
* **Bonus:** control the Phoniebox from your phone or computer via a web app.

![The web app allows you to change the volume level, list and play audio files and folders, stop the player and shut down the RPi gracefully.](docs/img/web-app-iphone-screens.jpg "The web app allows you to change the volume level, list and play audio files and folders, stop the player and shut down the RPi gracefully.")

The **web app** runs on any device and is mobile optimised. It provides:

* An audio player to pause, resume, shuffle, loop, stop and skip to previous and next track.
* Sub folder support: manage your collection in sub folders. Phoniebox has two play buttons: only this folder and eeeeverything in this folder.
* Manage files and folders via the web app.
* Register new RFID cards, manage Phoniebox settings, display system info and edit the wifi connection.
* Covers displayed in the web app (files called `cover.jpg`).

## Sustainability

You might be surprised how easy and affordable you can get a RaspberryPi or an "appropriate" housing for your Phoniebox **second hand**. Think about the planet before you buy a new one.
Creating a Phoniebox may be sustainable for the following reasons:

* You **buy things second hand** or **do upcycling on unused objects** and reduce newly produced products
* You built your Phoniebox yourself, so **maintaining and repairing is not a problem** (Additionally **a great community helps** you)
* Since the Phoniebox uses Linux as a base system it's **very unlikely that you run out of system and security updates** - so it can run and run and run...
* **RFID cards or tags can be reused - no need to buy new plastic elements** for changing the music or story linked to a card
* **Build it together with your kids** to show them that building things on their own is possible and in cooperation with others makes life easier and fun at the same time
