# RPi-Jukebox-RFID
A jukebox for the Raspberry Pi, playing local audio files, playlists or even web streams triggered by RFID cards. All plug and play via USB, no soldering iron needed. Update: if you must, it now also features a howto for adding GPIO buttons controls.

What makes this jukebox easy to install and use:

* Runs on all Raspberry Pi models (1, 2 and 3) and [Raspberry Zero](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/issues/15).
* Just plug and play using USB, no soldering iron needed.
* Once the jukebox is up and running, add music from any computer on your home network.
* Register new RFID cards easily without having to connect to the RPi.
* Play single or multiple files, even mix them with web streams.
* Volume control is also done with RFID cards or key fobs.
* Connect to your jukebox via your wifi network or run the jukebox like an access point and connect directly without a router.
* **Bonus:** control the jukebox from your phone or computer via a web app.

![The web app allows you to change the volume level, list and play audio files and folders, stop the player and shut down the RPi gracefully.](docs/img/web-app-iphone-screens.png "The web app allows you to change the volume level, list and play audio files and folders, stop the player and shut down the RPi gracefully.")

The web app runs on any device and is mobile optimised. It provides:

* An audio player to pause, resume, stop and skip to previous and next track.
* Control and change the volume level.
* Full list of all available audio and trigger to play it from the browser.
* Shutdown or reboot the RPi gracefully.

## Installation

Follow the instructions in the [`INSTALL.md`](docs/INSTALL.md) file in the `docs` folder.

Then walk through the configuration of the RPi here: [`CONFIGURE.md`](docs/CONFIGURE.md)

Once everything is set up and configured, read the manual to register cards and add audio: [`MANUAL.md`](docs/MANUAL.md)

Adding push buttons to control volume, skipping tracks, pause, play: read the [GPIO buttons installation guide](docs/GPIO-BUTTONS.md).

## Manual

In [`MANUAL.md`](docs/MANUAL.md) you will learn:

* [How to connect to the jukebox from any computer to add and edit audio files.](docs/MANUAL.md#connect)
* [How to register new RFID cards, assign them a *human readable* shortcut and add audio files for each card.](docs/MANUAL.md#registercards)
* [How to add web streams to the playout files](docs/MANUAL.md#webstreams) - [and even mix web based and local files.](docs/MANUAL.md#mixwebstreams)
* [How to control the jukebox through the web app.](docs/MANUAL.md#webapp)
* [How to assign cards specific tasks such as changing the volume level or shutting down the jukebox.](docs/MANUAL.md#cardcontrol)

## Troubleshooting

* [I am moving, how do I get the jukebox into my new WiFi network?](docs/MANUAL.md#changewifisettings)

## Acknowledgments

There are many, many, many inspiring suggestions and solutions on the web to bring together the idea of a jukebox with RFID cards. I want to mention a few of these that have inspired me.

* Thanks to Andreas aka [hailogugo](https://github.com/hailogugo) for writing and testing the script for the [GPIO buttons as controllers for the jukebox](docs/GPIO-BUTTONS.md).
* [Francisco Sahli's Music Cards: RFID cards + Spotify + Raspberry Pi](https://fsahli.wordpress.com/2015/11/02/music-cards-rfid-cards-spotify-raspberry-pi/) written in python, playing songs from Spotify. The code [music-cards](https://github.com/fsahli/music-cards) is on GitHub.

For my rendition of the RFID jukebox, I have forked two files from [Francisco Sahli](https://github.com/fsahli/music-cards) to register the RFID reader and read the ID from the cards with the python scripts `Reader.py` and `RegisterDevice.py`.

I also want to link to two proprietary and commercial projects, because they also inspired me. And they challenged me, because of their shortcomings in terms of openness and in the case of tonies, the lack of "ownership" of the audiobooks and plays you actually bought. However, both products are very well made.

* [tonies® - das neue Audiosystem für mehr Hör-Spiel-Spaß im Kinderzimmer. (German)](https://tonies.de/) You buy a plastic figure which then triggers the audiofile - which is served over the web.
* [Hörbert - a MP3 player controlled by buttons](https://hoerbert.com) In Germany this has already become a *classic*. They also started selling a DIY kit.

## Shopping list

Here is a list of equipment needed. Chances are that you will find most of it in the back of your drawers or at the bottom of some shoe box. Well, most of it, possibly not the RFID reader itself.

* [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B ](http://amzn.to/2ku0PU7) | You might be surprised how easy and affordable you can get an RPi second hand. Think about the planet before you buy a new one.
* [Contactless RFID IC Card Reader with USB Interface PLUS 5 Cards + 5 Key Fob](http://amzn.to/2kXkMjr) | This package is good value for money, because it gets you started, including everything plus 5 RFID cards and 5 key fobs. 
* [USB Stereo Speaker Set (6 Watt, 3,5mm jack, USB-powered) black](http://amzn.to/2kXrard) | This USB powered speaker set sounds good for its size, is good value for money and keeps this RPi project clean and without the need of a soldering iron :)
* [External USB Soundcard with Virtual Surround Sound, Plug & Play](http://amzn.to/2kXflBf) | The additional soundcard is optional. If you don't like the sound coming straight from the RPi jack, this is a good value for money USB soundcard.
* [USB A Male to Female Extenstion Cable with Switch On/Off](http://amzn.to/2hHrvkG) | I placed this USB extension between the USB power adapter and the jukebox. This will allow you to switch the jukebox on and off easily.
* [USB 2.0 Hub 4-port bus powered USB Adapter](http://amzn.to/2kXeErv) | Depending on your setup, you will need none, one or two of these. If you are using the external USB powered speakers, you need one to make sure the speakers get enough power. If you want to use the additional USB soundcard and have an older RPi, you might need a second one to make sure you can connect enough devices with the RPi.
