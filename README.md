# Phoniebox: the RPi-Jukebox-RFID
A contactless jukebox for the Raspberry Pi, playing local audio files, playlists or even web streams triggered by RFID cards. All plug and play via USB, no soldering iron needed. Update: if you must, it now also features a howto for adding GPIO buttons controls.

*Important update news*

* **Phoniebox 0.9.7 released** The next release after that will not (actively) support `jessie` anymore. And will replace `VLC` with `mpd` to save battery power and add *resume play* as a feature - which is not meant for toddlers but audiobook lovers (aka Phoniebox is growing up!). On the [release page you can find a list of features](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/releases). (2018-07-19)
* **Changing audio player? Your thoughts please** There is a [new branch with 'resume play'](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/tree/pr80-mpd-as-audio-player) in the repo using `mpd` instead of `vlc` for audio playout. What do you think? Use this [thread for feedback and opinions](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/issues/79) (2018-07-17)
* **Podcasts!** More for myself than anybody else, I guess, I added the [podcast feature for Phoniebox](docs/MANUAL.md#podcasts) (2018-05-09)
* **`config.php` removed in repo** To fix a flaw of the initial commit, I removed the `config.php` file from the `htdocs` directory. It will be created automatically from `config.php.sample`. If you encounter problems after `git pull`, download [`config.php.sample`](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/blob/master/htdocs/config.php.sample) adjust and copy to `config.php`.

*See the Phoniebox code in action, watch this video and read the blog post from [iphone-ticker.de](https://www.iphone-ticker.de/wochenend-projekt-kontaktlose-musikbox-fuer-kinder-123063/)*

**What makes this Phoniebox easy to install and use:**

* Runs on all Raspberry Pi models (1, 2 and 3) and [Raspberry Zero](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/issues/15). (jump to the [install instructions](#install))
* Just plug and play using USB, no soldering iron needed.
* Once the Phoniebox is up and running, add music from any computer on your home network.
* Register new RFID cards easily without having to connect to the RPi.
* Play single or multiple files, even mix them with web streams.
* Volume control is also done with RFID cards or key fobs.
* Connect to your Phoniebox via your wifi network or run the Phoniebox like an access point and connect directly without a router.
* **Bonus:** control the Phoniebox from your phone or computer via a web app.

![The web app allows you to change the volume level, list and play audio files and folders, stop the player and shut down the RPi gracefully.](docs/img/web-app-iphone-screens.png "The web app allows you to change the volume level, list and play audio files and folders, stop the player and shut down the RPi gracefully.")

The web app runs on any device and is mobile optimised. It provides:

* An audio player to pause, resume, stop and skip to previous and next track.
* Control and change the volume level.
* Full list of all available audio and trigger to play it from the browser.
* Shutdown or reboot the RPi gracefully.

## <a name="install"></a>Installation

* Installation instructions for Raspbian [Jessie](docs/INSTALL-jessie.md) and [Stretch](docs/INSTALL-stretch.md) are available in the `docs` folder.
* You can also use the [headless installation over ssh](docs/INSTALL-stretch.md#ssh-install) straight from a fresh SD card.
* For a quick install procedure, take a look at the [bash install script for Jessie](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/blob/master/scripts/installscripts/jessie-install-default-01.sh) or the [bash install script for Stretch](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/blob/master/scripts/installscripts/stretch-install-default-01.sh). This should get you started quickly, but you still need to walk through the following steps:
* Configure the Phoniebox after having installed all the components. See details for [Jessie](docs/CONFIGURE-jessie.md) or [Stretch](docs/CONFIGURE-stretch.md).
* Once everything has been installed and configured, read the manual to change settings, register RFID cards, add audio: [`MANUAL.md`](docs/MANUAL.md)

Adding push buttons to control volume, skipping tracks, pause, play: read the [GPIO buttons installation guide](docs/GPIO-BUTTONS.md).

*A German version for the installation ... hier ist eine etwas überholte [deutsche Version der Installationsdoku für Jessie](http://docplayer.org/68280452-Anleitung-jukebox-kinder-https-github-com-miczflor-rpi-jukebox-rfid-mit-buttons-und-hifiberry-miniamp.html) von [hailogugo](https://forum-raspberrypi.de/user/51824-hailogugo/)*

## Contributing improvements

The preferred way of code contributions are [pull requests (follow this link for a small howto)](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github). And ideally pull requests using the "running code" on your Phoniebox. Alternatively, feel free to post tweaks, suggestions and snippets in the ["issues" section](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/issues).

## Reporting bugs

If you find something that doesn't work. And you tried and tried again, but it still doesn't work, please report your issue in the ["issues" section](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/issues). Make sure to include information about the system and hardware you are using, like: 

*Raspberry ZERO, OS Jessie, Card reader lists as (insert here) when running scripts/RegisterDevice.py, installed Phoniebox version 0.9.3 (or: using latest master branch).*

## Troubleshooting

There is a growing section of [troubleshooting](docs/MANUAL.md#faq) including:

* I want to improve the onboard audio quality
* I am moving, how do I get the Phoniebox into my new WiFi network?
* The RFID Reader doesn't seem to work.
* Changing the volume does not work, but the playout works.
* Script `daemon_rfid_reader.py` only works via SSH not by RFID cards.
* Script daemon is closing down unexpectedly.
* Everything seems to work, but I hear nothing when swiping a card.
* I would like to use two cards / IDs to do the same thing.

## Acknowledgments

There are many, many, many inspiring suggestions and solutions on the web to bring together the idea of a jukebox with RFID cards. I want to mention a few of these that have inspired me.

* Thanks to Andreas aka [hailogugo](https://github.com/hailogugo) for writing and testing the script for the [GPIO buttons as controllers for the jukebox](docs/GPIO-BUTTONS.md).

* [Willem van der Jagt's How I built an audio book reader for my nearly blind grandfather](http://willemvanderjagt.com/2014/08/16/audio-book-reader/) written in python and using the MDP player.

For my rendition of the RFID jukebox, I have forked two files from [Francisco Sahli](https://github.com/fsahli/music-cards) to register the RFID reader and read the ID from the cards with the python scripts `Reader.py` and `RegisterDevice.py`.

I also want to link to two proprietary and commercial projects, because they also inspired me. And they challenged me, because of their shortcomings in terms of openness and in the case of tonies, the lack of "ownership" of the audiobooks and plays you actually bought. However, both products are very well made.

* [tonies® - das neue Audiosystem für mehr Hör-Spiel-Spaß im Kinderzimmer. (German)](https://tonies.de/) You buy a plastic figure which then triggers the audiofile - which is served over the web.
* [Hörbert - a MP3 player controlled by buttons](https://hoerbert.com) In Germany this has already become a *classic*. They also started selling a DIY kit.

## Shopping list

Here is a list of equipment needed. Chances are that you will find most of it in the back of your drawers or at the bottom of some shoe box. Well, most of it, possibly not the RFID reader itself.

* [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B ](http://amzn.to/2ku0PU7) | You might be surprised how easy and affordable you can get an RPi second hand. Think about the planet before you buy a new one.
* [Contactless RFID IC Card Reader with USB Interface PLUS 5 Cards + 5 Key Fob](http://amzn.to/2kXkMjr) | This package is good value for money, because it gets you started, including everything plus 5 RFID cards and 5 key fobs. 
* [USB Stereo Speaker Set (6 Watt, 3,5mm jack, USB-powered) black](http://amzn.to/2kXrard) | This USB powered speaker set sounds good for its size, is good value for money and keeps this RPi project clean and without the need of a soldering iron :)
* [External USB Soundcard with Virtual Surround Sound, Plug & Play](http://amzn.to/2kXflBf) | The additional soundcard is optional. If you don't like the sound coming straight from the RPi jack, this is a good value for money USB soundcard.
* [USB A Male to Female Extenstion Cable with Switch On/Off](http://amzn.to/2hHrvkG) | I placed this USB extension between the USB power adapter and the Phoniebox. This will allow you to switch the Phoniebox on and off easily.
* [USB 2.0 Hub 4-port bus powered USB Adapter](http://amzn.to/2kXeErv) | Depending on your setup, you will need none, one or two of these. If you are using the external USB powered speakers, you need one to make sure the speakers get enough power. If you want to use the additional USB soundcard and have an older RPi, you might need a second one to make sure you can connect enough devices with the RPi.
