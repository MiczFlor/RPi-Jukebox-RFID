What is this?
================================================

The exciting, new **Version 3** of the RPi Jukebox RFID. A complete rewrite of the Jukebox code base.

.. important:: This documentation applies to the Version 3 which is developed in the branches *future3/main* and *future3/develop*.
    Currently the default Version is 2.X

To find out more about the RPi Jukebox RFID
project check out the `documentation of Version 2 <https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID>`_ or `www.phoniebox.de <https://www.phoniebox.de/>`_.

Why?
-----

* Better extensibility, clear architecture allowing easier integration of new feature
* Higher performance especially on lower end hardware (it's a stetch at the moment)
* Better maintainability
* Better observability for debugging

How?
------

* Jukebox core is a holistic Python3-only application
* Avoid shell script invocation during runtime wherever possible
* Establish a socket based API (using ZeroMQ) toward the WebUI or other clients
* Implemented a Remote-Procedure-Call (RPC) server through which all user function call pass
* Implemented a plugin concept to dynamically load Python modules configurable through the configuration file
* In conjunction with the RPC, this is a neat way of allowing additional feature without having to touch the core all the time

Where are we? Help wanted!
--------------------------

The initial proof-of-concept phase has been left behind and there is quite some functionality available already.
This is still heavily in progress but the WebUI and RFID-triggered playback of local files work.

Features/files from version 2.X will only be copied/merged when they can be integrated and tested.
If you don't find your v2.X contributions, it doesn't mean they are obsolete. Things will be integrated step by step.
And, of course, you are welcome to adapt your previous contributions to this new exiting structure.
