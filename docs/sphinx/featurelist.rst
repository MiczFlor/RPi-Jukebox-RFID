Feature Status
****************

This is where we are in a nutshell: Playing music from local folders via RFID trigger. We also built a new WebUI to control
the Jukebox from a browser.

The are a few things that are specifically not integrated yet: GPIOs, playing streams, podcasts or Spotify.

Overview
--------

Here is the currently implemented feature list in more detail. It also shows some of the holes. However the list
is not complete in terms of planned features, but probably reflects more of where work is currently being put into.

.. contents::

* |[ ]| Method to change configuration through WebUI
  * The difficulty lies bringing the running Jukebox to accept the changes
* |[ ]| Strategy to post config changes via PubSub

    * e.g. volume change is posted repeatedly with status
    * but what about set_max_volume, is shutdown timer active?

* |[ ]| Clean up of surplus files
* |[X]| Host interface (shutdown, reboot)
* |[X]| Temperature getter / publisher
* |[ ]| is_throttled getter / publisher
* |[X]| Version number getter / Git Hash

  * |[ ]| Log and publish this!

* |[ ]| Exit via RPC
* |[ ]| Service restart via RPC

  * |[ ]| Check if really running as a service

* |[X]| Storage space getter / publisher (shutil.disk_usage)
* |[X]| Getter for error logs to show in WebUI

    * Get file location from FileHandlers (files may be stale!)
    * Logger might be disabled or not connected

* |[ ]| Enable/Disable debug logging from RPC
* |[X]| Publisher of errors (specialized logger handler)

    * This is a configurable logger handler in logger.yaml

* |[X]| Basic Logging Config should enable Publisher stream handler
* |[ ]| Disable Console Stream Handler (or set to warning) when running as a service
* |[X]| Log & publish start time

* |[ ]| /shared/references: plugin_reference / rpc commands reference / card actions reference / card db summary

Via RPC
-------

  * |[X]| List of loaded / failed plugins
  * |[X]| card action reference
  * |[X]| Help command (available commands)

      * which basically is a plugin reference

Config handler

    * |[ ]| Podcast
    * |[ ]| Livestreams
    * |[ ]| NEW: Playback of m3u playlists (e.g. folder.m3u) ?

* |[ ]| Folder configuration `Reference <https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/wiki/MANUAL#manage-playout-behaviour>`_

  * |[ ]| Resume: Save and restore position (how interact with shuffle?)
  * |[ ]| Single: Enable mpc single
  * |[ ]| Shuffle: Enable mpc random (not shuffle)

        * Rename to random, as this is mpc random

  * |[ ]| Loop: Loop playlist

MPD Player
--------------

* |[ ]| Thread safety for status information / configuration
* |[ ]| Differential status post
* |[ ]| Second swipe option setter via RPC
* |[ ]| Volume publisher for ALSA / MPD switchable

    * |[ ]| ALSA volume check with select.poll()

* |[ ]| Before every music lib update, player should check user rights (not only after start-up)

RFID
--------------

* |[X]| Test with Reader disabled
* |[X]| Start-up behaviour with un-configured Reader
* |[X]| Command card -> is now parameter ignore_same_id_delay

    * Skip to next track
    * Re-start playlist

* |[X]| Simplified quick_select action shortcuts for often used card commands

    * |[ ]| Port all previous card commands
    * |[X]| Reference file write-out

        * |[ ]| Improve readability

    * |[X]| Card reference IF via RPC (?)
    * |[ ]| Export available quick selects commands to RPC

GPIO
--------------

* |[ ]| Everything needs porting

    * Function call routines need replacing to do RPC Calls
    * Configuration format probably best changed to YAML

* |[ ]| Status LED probably needs re-writing to benefit fully from plugin structure
* |[ ]| USB Buttons: It's a different category as it works similar to the RFID cards
* |[ ]| Port rfid pin action to GPIO as a general pin service for all plugins
