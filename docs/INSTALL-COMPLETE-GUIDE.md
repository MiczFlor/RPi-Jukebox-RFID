# How to set up a Phoniebox from scratch

## What you need

All parts marked with a star (*) are optional but improve the overall experience. All linked components are examples but have proven to work together. You are free to choose different equipment.

1. [Micro SD Card](https://amzn.to/3do7KJr) (e.g. 32 GB)
1. Raspberry Pi
    * [Model 4 B](https://amzn.to/2M0xtfJ)
    * [Model 3 B+](https://amzn.to/2NGL7Fa)
    * (Model 1, 2, 3 and Zero are possible, but they are slow...)
1. [USB RFID Reader](https://amzn.to/3s47Iun)
1. [RFID Chips](https://amzn.to/3k78F2j) or [RFID Cards](https://amzn.to/3dplljG)
1. [Speakers with 3.5mm jack](https://amzn.to/3dnhmnV)

To improve the sound, we recommend:

* [Ground Loop Isolator](https://amzn.to/37nyZjK) *

Alternatively you can use an external sound card, but sometimes that doesn't seem to improve much:

* [USB Sound Card](https://amzn.to/3djaKqC) * - [Alternative](https://amzn.to/3u8guth)

You'll need a few other things for a one time set up only.

1. Second computer (Linux, Mac or Windows)
1. USB Mouse and USB Keyboard
1. Micro SD Card Reader
1. Screen with HDMI connection

Alternative: 
* If you are able to connect your Raspberry Pi via a wired network interface (LAN), you can set it up via terminal (SSH) only.
* It's also possible to set up a Pi with [WiFi and ssh](https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/10251/prepare-sd-card-for-wifi-on-headless-pi/57023#57023).

## Install Raspberry Pi OS on a Micro SD card

Before you can install the Phoniebox software, you need to prepare your Raspberry Pi and install 

1. Connect your Micro SD card (through a card reader) to your computer
1. [Download](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/) the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-imager-imaging-utility/) and open it
1. Select **Raspberry Pi OS** as the operating system (Recommended)
1. Select your Micro SD card (card will be formatted)
1. Click `Write`
1. Wait for the imaging process to be finished (it'll take a few minutes) and eject your SD card

## Initial boot - Set up Wifi connection

1. Connect a USB mouse, a keyboard and a screen through HDMI
1. Insert the Micro SD card
1. Start your Raspberry Pi by attaching a power supply
1. Walk through the "Welcome to Raspberry Pi" wizard (the content of this wizard might have changed after this tutorial was created!)
    1. Set your locale
    1. Change your password
    1. Proceed with with screen settings
    1. Select your Wifi Network (You are being asked in the Phoniebox install routine whether you want to set up your Wifi again, we will skip this step then)
    1. Software Update (optional, recommended, takes a while)
    1. Reboot
1. Let's enable a few more settings
    1. Launch `Raspberry Pi Configuration` from the `Preferences` menu
    1. A window opens with the `System` tab selected
    1. Select `To CLI` for `Boot` option
    1. Select `Login as user 'pi'` for `Auto login` option
    1. Select `Wait for network` for `Network at Boot` option (optional, required for Spotify+ version)
    1. Navigate to the `Interfaces` tab
    1. Select `Enabled` next to `SSH`
    1. Click `OK`
1. Set up a static IP (optional, recommended)
    1. Right click on the Wifi sympbol in the upper right corner of your application bar and choose `Wifi & Wired Network Settings`
    1. Configure `interface` and `wlan0`
    1. Check `Disabled IPv6` unless you want to provide a static IPv6 address
    1. Fill out `IPv4` and `Router` (Gateway) options (keep `DNS Servers` and `DNS Search` empty)
    1. Click `Apply` and `Close`
1. Optional: If you like, you can **turn off Bluetooth** to reduce energy consumption (unless you want to use any Bluetooth devices with your Phoniebox)
1. Shutdown your Raspberry Pi (`Application > Logout > Shutdown`)

## Install Phoniebox software

If you want to install the **Spotify+ version**, [read this first](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/wiki/Spotify-FAQ).

1. While shut down, disconnect mouse, keyboard and HDMI
1. Connect RFID Reader
1. Conntect USB Sound Card, plug in the 3.5" speakers with the Ground Loop Isolator in between. If you have chosen the example speakers from above, you can power them either through the Raspberry Pi or through an external power source.
1. Boot your Raspberry Pi
1. Open a terminal in your second computer and login via SSH using the `pi` user and your static IP address. If you see a question about authentication and fingerprint, type `yes` and hit `enter`
    ```
    ssh pi@192.168.1.123
    ```

### Using on-board headphone-jack for audio

Note: Installing with an external monitor (HDMI) can create a problem if you use the mini-jack audio out. The problem is that if you plug in a HDMI monitor an additional sound output is added and the index changes. This bothering behavior was introduced, when Raspberry Pi separated headphones jack and HDMI into two different devices in May 2020.

See: [Troubleshooting: headphone audio unavailable after unplugging HDMI](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/discussions/1300)

If this problem occurs, follow the steps in the next section (configure USB sound card).

### Configure USB sound card (if you are using one)


1. Configure your **USB sound card**. Check if your sound card has been detected
    ```
    cat /proc/asound/modules

    // returns

    0 snd_bcm2835
    1 snd_usb_audio
    ```
1. To update the sound card priority order, edit the following file
    ```
    sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf
    ```
1. Find the following variables and change their value from `0` to `1`
    ```
    defaults.ctl.card 0
    defaults.pcm.card 0

    // to

    defaults.ctl.card 1
    defaults.pcm.card 1
    ```
1. Reboot
1. Test your audio! Check if you hear white noise in stereo when running the following command from your connected speakers. If not, refer to this [resource](https://learn.adafruit.com/usb-audio-cards-with-a-raspberry-pi/instructions) to troubleshoot.
    ```
    speaker-test -c2
    ```

### Phoniebox Install Script

Run the following command in your SSH terminal and follow the instructions

```
cd; rm buster-install-*; wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/master/scripts/installscripts/buster-install-default.sh; chmod +x buster-install-default.sh; ./buster-install-default.sh
```

1. `Yes` to `Continue interactive installation`
1. `No` to the `Wifi Setting step` - it's already set!
1. `Master` to `CONFIGURE AUDIO INTERFACE (iFace)`
1. Setup Spotify (optional)
    1. You need to generate your personal Spotify client ID and secret
    1. Visit the [Mopidy Spotify Authentication Page](https://mopidy.com/ext/spotify/#authentication)
    1. Click the button `Authenticate Mopidy with Spotify`
    1. Login to Spotify with your credentials
    1. Once logged in, the code snippet on the website is updated with your `client_id` and `client_secret`
    1. Provide your Spotify `username`, `password` and paste your `client_id` and `client_secret` into your terminal
1. `Yes` to `CONFIGURE MPD`
1. `Yes` to `FOLDER CONTAINING AUDIO FILES`
1. Optional: In this scenario, we do not install GPIO buttons, so feel free to choose `No`
1. `Yes` to `Do you want to start the installation?`
1. `Yes` to `Have you connected your RFID reader?`
1. `1` to select `1. USB-Reader`

## Verify Phoniebox installation

1. Open a browser in your computer and navigate to your static IP: `http://192.168.1.123`
1. You should see the Phoniebox UI
1. In your navigation, choose `Card ID`
1. Swipe one card near your RFID reader. If `Last used Chip ID` is automatically updated (you might hear a beep) and shows a number, your reader works
1. Verify Spotify (optional)
    1. Click `Spotify+` in the menu
    1. Mopidy opens, a second web player which was also installed
    1. You should be able to search and play Spotify content here
