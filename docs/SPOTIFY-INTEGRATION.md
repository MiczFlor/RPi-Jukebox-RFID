# Spotify support for Phoniebox (this guide is for all who want to manually update to +Spotify Edition)

**MUST READ**

If you want to integrate Spotify:

* You **must have** a Spotify Premium subscription. Phoniebox will not work with Spotify Free, just Spotify Premium. 
* You need a non-Facebook Spotify username and password. 
  * If you created your account through Facebook you'll need to create a "device password" to be able to use Phoniebox. Go to http://www.spotify.com/account/set-device-password/, login with your Facebook account, and follow the instructions. However, sometimes that process can fail for users with Facebook logins, in which case you can create an app-specific password on Facebook by going to facebook.com > Settings > Security > App passwords > Generate app passwords, and generate one to use with Phoniebox.
* MP3 (local music) handling has completely changed for the +Spotify Edition. The tracks  need to be indexed by Mopidy & Mopidy-Spotify (this is the part of Phoniebox, which gives you spotify support) and the created M3U files do have another structure than normal M3U files.
  * You have to scan you library once (if you hadn't yet) and everytime you upload new local tracks to your Phoniebox.
  * You can scan local files under "Folders & Files" (Top Navigation).
  * For the future we try to integrate an automation for that.

## Bug reports and testers

**Testers needed for the Spotify integration** Please read [more in this thread](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/issues/18#issuecomment-430140524).

If you open an issue on github, please provide as much informations as you can. What is you Edition (Classic or +Spotify)? Which version so you have? What is the problem and what did you try to solve this? And so on..

## About this document

You best start will be to start a FRESH INSTALLATION, please read [more here](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/wiki/INSTALL-stretch#one-line-install-command).

The one-line-install should detect an existing installation and ask you if you want to keep the content. That should work, no guarantee :) a backup won't hurt anyone.

The below documentation might be out of date. The one-line-install script will be more up to date. But the below still exists, because it has more content about how the integration works - and that might help you to understand a problem if and when it occurs. Please add, edit and comment to this document while testing the code.

## Installing Buster on your Pi

1. Install Buster on SD Card.
2. Remove card and insert again.

Setting up the Phoniebox via a SSH connection saves the need for a monitor and a mouse. The following worked on Raspian Buster.

* Flash your SD card with the Raspian image
* Eject the card and insert it again. This should get the boot partition mounted.
* In the boot partition, create a new empty file called ssh. This will enable the SSH server later.
* Create another file in the same place called wpa_supplicant.conf. Set the file content according to the following example:
~~~
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
network={
	ssid="YOUR_NETWORK_NAME"
	psk="YOUR_PASSWORD"
	key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}
~~~
Note: This works for WPA-secured wifi networks, which should be the vast majority.

* Save the file
* Unmount and eject the card, insert it into the Raspy, boot.
* Find out the IP address of the raspberry. Most Wifi routers have a user interface that lists all devices in the network with the IP address they got assigned.
* Connect via ssh with username pi and password raspberry.
* Jump back to the top of this document to walk through the other steps of the installation.

## If you have a USB Sound Card: Correct the Sort Order

~~~
cat /proc/asound/modules
~~~
You get:
~~~
0 snd_bcm2835
1 snd_usb_audio
~~~
Change sort order:
~~~
sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf
~~~
If file is empty, add the following lines:
~~~
options snd_usb_audio index=0
options snd_bcm2835 index=1
options snd slots=snd-usb-audio,snd-bcm2835
~~~
After reboot you get:
~~~
cat /proc/asound/modules

0 snd_usb_audio
1 snd_bcm2835
~~~
## If you need Root-User, get your system prepared
~~~
sudo passwd root
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
~~~
Search for PermitRootLogin and change 

~~~
#PermitRootLogin prohibit-password
~~~
to
~~~
PermitRootLogin yes
~~~
	
## Install MOPIDY
Pin major version of Mopidy to 3
~~~
echo -e "Package: mopidy\nPin: version 3.*\nPin-Priority: 1001" | sudo tee /etc/apt/preferences.d/mopidy
~~~
Add the archive’s GPG key:
~~~
wget -q -O - https://apt.mopidy.com/mopidy.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
~~~
Add the APT repo to your package sources:
~~~
sudo wget -q -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mopidy.list https://apt.mopidy.com/buster.list
~~~
Install Mopidy and all dependencies:
~~~
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get --yes --allow-downgrades --allow-remove-essential --allow-change-held-packages install mopidy mopidy-mpd mopidy-local mopidy-spotify
~~~
Finally, you need to set a couple of config values, and then you’re ready to run Mopidy. Alternatively you may want to have Mopidy run as a system service, automatically starting at boot.

To install one of the listed packages, e.g. mopidy-spotify, simply run the following:
~~~
sudo apt-get --yes --allow-downgrades --allow-remove-essential --allow-change-held-packages install libspotify12 python3-cffi python3-ply python3-pycparser python3-spotify
~~~

## Mopidy as service...

On modern systems using systemd you can enable the Mopidy service by running:
~~~
sudo systemctl enable mopidy
~~~
This will make Mopidy start when the system boots.
	
## Install MOPIDY-IRIS Web Interface
~~~
sudo python3 -m pip install Mopidy-Iris
~~~

Set the rights
~~~
sudo nano /etc/sudoers
~~~
Add this line to the end
~~~
mopidy ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mopidy_iris/system.sh
~~~

You have to reboot now.
~~~
sudo reboot
~~~

## Configure Mopidy...
~~~
sudo nano /etc/mopidy/mopidy.conf
~~~
This file should look like this (you first have to get client-id and client-secret here: https://www.mopidy.com/authenticate/ )
This must be done manually. Put your username, password, client_id, client_secret into the spotify section.
The audio section has to be tested, because i don't know if  "output = alsasink" works for everyone. "mixer_volume" is the start volume of phoniebox! attention: if you leave this blank, volume will be 100% after reboot!!

## Install Phoniebox (if not done yet) - if you want to UPGRADE to spotify only, skip this step
~~~
cd; rm stretch-install-*; wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/master/scripts/installscripts/stretch-install-spotify.sh; chmod +x stretch-install-spotify.sh; ./stretch-install-spotify.sh
~~~
## Change Playlists_Folders_Path to:
~~~
/home/pi/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/playlists
~~~
## You have to disable MPD because we use mopidy instead and MPD is included there.

If you don't disable MPD here, mopidy will not run!!!
~~~
sudo systemctl disable mpd
~~~
## Charset problems in display?
If you have problems with UTF-8 and ANSI, try to start raspi-config and change localisation to UTF-8.
I don't know if it works, for me it does after several tries.

## How to use Spotify?

When you right-click an album, a track or a playlist in MOPIDY IRIS or Spotify Client (share button), you get a Spotify URI.
This Spotify URI must be used when registering a card with the following syntax:
~~~
Tracks: spotify:track:######################
Albums: spotify:album:######################
Playlists: spotify:user:username:playlist:######################
(e.g. spotify:user:spotify:playlist:37i9dQZF1DWUVpAXiEPK8P or 
spotify:user:tomorrowlandofficial:playlist:0yS25E7g9xQZ1Dst5SqUZn)

Podcast: spotify:show:###################### (This has not been tested yet!)
~~~
The information will be stored in a spotify.txt in an audiofolder.
