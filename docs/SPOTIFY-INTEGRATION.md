# Spotify support for Phoniebox

**Testers needed for the Spotify integration** to make it universal and include into the install process soon. Please read [more in this thread](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/issues/18#issuecomment-430140524).
This is the first draft (2018-10-16) of the documentation on how to integrate Spotify into your Phoniebox. It starts from scratch (i.e. with the installation of the stretch OS). Please add, edit and comment to this document while testing the code on the `develop` branch. 

## Installing stretch on your Pi

1. Install Strech on SD Card.
2. Remove card and insert again.

Setting up the Phoniebox via a SSH connection saves the need for a monitor and a mouse. The following worked on Raspian stretch.

* Flash your SD card with the Raspian image
* Eject the card and insert it again. This should get the boot partition mounted.
* In the boot partition, create a new empty file called ssh. This will enable the SSH server later.
* Create another file in the same place called wpa_supplicant.conf. Set the file content according to the following example:
~~~
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
network={
	ssid="YOUR_NETWORK_NAME"
	psk="YOUR_PASSWORD"
	key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}
~~~
Note: This works for WPA-secured wifi networks, which should be the vast majority.

* Save the file
* Unmount and eject the card, insert it into the Raspy, boot.
* Find out the IP address of the raspberry. Most Wifi routers have a user interface that lists all devices in the network with the IP address they got assigned.
* Connect via ssh with username pi and password raspberry.
* Jump back to the top of this document to walk through the other steps of the installation.

## Sort Order of sound cards - correction.

~~~
cat /proc/asound/modules
~~~
You get:
~~~
0 snd_bcm2835
1 snd_usb_audio
~~~
Change sort order:
~~~
sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf
~~~
If file is empty, add the following lines:
~~~
options snd_usb_audio index=0
options snd_bcm2835 index=1
options snd slots=snd-usb-audio,snd-bcm2835
~~~
After reboot you get:
~~~
cat /proc/asound/modules

0 snd_usb_audio
1 snd_bcm2835
~~~
## For Root-User
~~~
sudo passwd root
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
~~~
Search for PermitRootLogin and change it to yes.
	
## Install MOPIDY

Add the archive’s GPG key:
~~~
wget -q -O - https://apt.mopidy.com/mopidy.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
~~~
Add the APT repo to your package sources:
~~~
sudo wget -q -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mopidy.list https://apt.mopidy.com/stretch.list
~~~
Install Mopidy and all dependencies:
~~~
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install mopidy
~~~
Finally, you need to set a couple of config values, and then you’re ready to run Mopidy. Alternatively you may want to have Mopidy run as a system service, automatically starting at boot.

To install one of the listed packages, e.g. mopidy-spotify, simply run:
sudo apt-get install mopidy-spotify
		
**The actual master branch of mopidy_spotify is not working with playlists from spotify.
To fix this, you have to integrate alle file from this fork:**
~~~
https://github.com/BlackLight/mopidy-spotify/tree/fix/incompatible_playlists/mopidy_spotify
~~~
The files MUST be put here on the phoniebox:
~~~
/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mopidy_spotify/
~~~
I think there is a method to get this over git via installerscript.
This method worked for me: git clone -b fix/incompatible_playlists --single-branch https://github.com/BlackLight/mopidy-spotify.git

## Mopidy as service...

On modern systems using systemd you can enable the Mopidy service by running:
~~~
sudo systemctl enable mopidy
~~~
This will make Mopidy start when the system boots.
Mopidy is started, stopped, and restarted just like any other systemd service:
~~~
sudo systemctl start mopidy
sudo systemctl stop mopidy
sudo systemctl restart mopidy
~~~
You can check if Mopidy is currently running as a service by running:
~~~
sudo systemctl status mopidy
~~~		
## Install MOPIDY-IRIS Web Interface
~~~
sudo pip install Mopidy-Iris
su -
sudo echo "mopidy ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mopidy_iris/system.sh" >> /etc/sudoers
sudo reboot
~~~
## Configure Mopidy...
~~~
sudo nano /etc/mopidy/mopidy.conf
~~~
Add to the end if entries not exist (client id und secret hier erstellen: https://www.mopidy.com/authenticate/ )
~~~

## Install Phoniebox
~~~
cd; rm stretch-install-default*; wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/master/scripts/installscripts/stretch-install-default.sh; chmod +x stretch-install-default.sh; ./stretch-install-default.sh
~~~
## Change Playlists_Folders_Path to:
~~~
/var/lib/mopidy/playlists
~~~
## You have to disable MPD because we use mopidy instead and MPD is included there.

If you don't disable MPD here, mopidy will not run!!!
~~~
sudo systemctl disable mpd
~~~
## Charset problems in display?
If you have problems with UTF-8 and ANSI, try to start raspi-config and change localisation to UTF-8.
I don't know if it works, for me it does after several tries.

## How to use Spotify?

When you right-click an album, a track or a playlist in MOPIDY IRIS or Spotify Client, you get a spotify URL.
This spotify URL must be used when registering a card.
It will be stored in a spotify.txt in an audiofolder.
