# How to setup a Pimoroni PirateAudio HAT

> [!NOTE]
> The display of the HATs currently only work with the 'spotify' edition, not with 'classic'!

These instructions are for the [Pimoroni PirateAudio HATs](https://shop.pimoroni.com/collections/audio?q=pirate%20audio)

## Installation

Run the `setup_pirateAudioHAT.sh` script to set it up to work with Phoniebox.

## Troubleshooting

The PirateAudio HATs use the same DAC as the HiFiBerry, so some of the instructions
from [HiFiBerry Soundcard Details](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/wiki/HiFiBerry-Soundcard-Details) can be applied as well.
