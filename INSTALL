Installing Phoniebox
====================

You can download the code or use git to keep up to date with the
latest changes. As a third option there are install scripts
available - which require a better understanding of what you are
doing.

Step by step manual
-------------------
The best way to walk through the install process would be to follow
the manuals inside the 'docs' folder.

Download
--------
You can either download the latest version as a zip / tarball at:
https://github.com/chbuehlmann/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/releases
The advantages of using the download option: your installation
will be running when it's running and changes in the code on
github will not change your installation.

1. Download the code as .zip or .tar.gz into your home directory
   /home/pi/
2. Unzip / untar the code. The code should now live inside a folder
   named 'RPi-Jukebox-RFID'
3. Consult the manual in the 'docs' folder to configure the system
   and set the correct folder access rights.

Git
---
The advantage of using git and the github repo means: you can always
update to the latest code changes. This can be a problem - for the
same reason - when changes in the code repository might require
additional changes in your installation. If you run into such
problems, check the file 'docs/UPGRADE.md'

The manuals are written with the 'git' installation process in mind,
please go to the 'docs' folder and read the manuals.

Install Scripts
---------------
Inside the folder 'scripts/installscripts' you can find bash files
which install the system in one go. However, you might need to change
some sample config files (e.g. static IP address).
If you want to use the install scripts, you seem to know what you are
doing, so roll up your sleeves, open them and read :)

All the best and don't forget to share your results with the community
