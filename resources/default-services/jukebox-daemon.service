# pulseaudio.service is required during shut down of this service,
# as we play shutdown sound (and adjust the volume). Else the service hangs and kills itself after 10s.
# This means we have must enforce the ordering AFTER pulseaudio
# pulseaudio is wanted by default.target, which means sound.target is not enough as after requirement
