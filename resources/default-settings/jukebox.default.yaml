pulse:
  # Reset system volume to this level after start. (Comment out disables and volume is not changed)
  startup_volume: 40
  # Automatically toggle output between primary and secondary audio output

  # Run the audio configuration tool to configure the pulseaudio sinks
  #
  # After startup, the audio output defaults to primary
  # Any Bluetooth device should be the secondary (as it may not always be available directly after boot)
  #
  # For manual setting of pulseaudio sinks use:
  # $ pactl list sinks short
  #
  # Test sinks with
  # $ paplay -D sink_name /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav
  #
  # Parameters:
  # - alias       : user defined alias for better readability
  # - volume_limit: a hard volume limit representing the new 100 %
  #                 i.e. the user input range 0...100 % will be scaled into this range
  #                 this can be used to attenuate the maximum volume levels between different outputs
  #                 i.e. make both channels equally load out 100 % and make sure it never gets too loud
